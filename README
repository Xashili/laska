Lasca is a draughts variant where instead of removing enemy pieces, they get imprisoned under the piece that jumped them.
Read more on the rules at http://www.lasca.org/ or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laska

This implementation is written in Elm (http://elm-lang.org/)
You can try the demo against a rather stupid bot at http://xashili.github.io/lasca/
